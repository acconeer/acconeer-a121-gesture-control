# Gesture control

This project will guide you through how to get started with gesture control, using Acconeer's A121 sensor.

In this repo, you will find
- data: A folder with data, used to train the model. Once you have run through the example with the supplied data, feel free to record you own data.
- model_development.ipynb: A notebook guiding you through the processes of feature extraction, model definition, training and evaluation.
- realtime_deployment.py: A python script executing the classification model in realtime.
- util.py: A python script containing util functions.
